# Telecommunications Project: NS3-Based Network Infrastructures

This repository contains the code and documentation for my telecommunications project, which was developed as part of my undergraduate studies in the Computer Science & Control Engineering course at Sapienza University.

The project focuses on the creation of two network infrastructures, one based on WiFi and the other on Ethernet, using NS3, along with the utilization of Wireshark and NetAnim for analysis and visualization.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project was to design and simulate two distinct network infrastructures:

1. **WiFi Infrastructure:** This component involves the setup and simulation of a WiFi network using NS3. The simulation includes various parameters, such as network topology, transmission characteristics, and mobility patterns.

2. **Ethernet Infrastructure:** Similarly, we simulated an Ethernet-based network infrastructure using NS3. This component also considers network topology, protocols, and other relevant parameters.

## Tools and Technologies

The following tools and technologies were utilized in this project:

- **NS3 (Network Simulator 3):** NS3 is an open-source network simulator widely used for network research and simulation. It allows for the creation and analysis of various network scenarios.

- **Wireshark:** Wireshark is a powerful network protocol analyzer. We used it to capture and inspect network traffic generated within our simulated infrastructures.

- **NetAnim:** NetAnim is a visualization tool that integrates seamlessly with NS3. It provides a graphical representation of network simulations, aiding in the visualization of network behavior.
